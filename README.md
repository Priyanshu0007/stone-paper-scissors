## Description

Creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game website using React.js and Sass involves designing a dynamic and engaging web application that allows users to play the classic hand game against the computer. Utilizing React for the frontend allows for interactive UI components, while Sass enhances styling capabilities. The website would include user interface elements for selecting their choice, displaying the computer's choice, keeping score, and providing feedback on the game's outcome. JavaScript logic would handle the game rules and determine the winner. With responsive design principles and Sass for organized styling, the website can offer an enjoyable and visually appealing gaming experience across various devices, making it a fun and educational project for both beginners and experienced developers.
